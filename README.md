# UFOs
JavaScript practice, creating a table fully dynamic 

## Overview 
The purpose of this project is to create a webpage with UFO information. 
It would be a database you can access by a table in the webpage and filter to each piece of information you want. 

## Resources
- Data: data.js
- Software: Javascript, Visual Code, HTML

## Results 
The webpage was created with dynamic filters - Data, City, State, Country, and Shape - to help with the use of data. 
In the image below, it is possible to observe how the filter can be applied.

## Summary 

Drawback:
- The site is not very obvious, so I put some buttons that would reset the filters, to facilitate searches 
and make the experience cleaner.

Recomendations:
- I would transform the information into a database that can be updated automatically, bringing more 
practicality and making the webpage more recent and more concrete information.
- Another recommendation will be to cross-reference the information already given, for example, 
to know which month there were more UFO sightings in a year and which regions have more reports, to observe if there is a pattern.
